#Tweet Cleaner

The code above defines a class for cleaning and pre-processing tweets which includes removing emotions, replacing mentions, separating co-joined words, eliminating extra spaces, correcting spelling, and deleting emojis. This pre-processing class is then applied to a dataset of tweets in a file, writing the cleaned output to a new file.
